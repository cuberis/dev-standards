## Introduction

Welcome to the Coding Standards for the Cuberis Development Team ðŸ‘‹! The goal of this document is to provide a reference for our preferred standards and practices for web development. By adhering to these standards, we ensure all team members can work efficiently between projects while also focusing on long-term maintainability.

## Who is this for?

The intended audience for this document is developers. If you aren't familiar with writing HTML, CSS, PHP and/or JavaScript, this is not going to be for you!

## Philosophy

Although, we build complex things, we aim to keep our code as simple and easy to understand as possible. Readability of code should always be favored over cleverness. This ensures that when a future developer picks up part a project, they will not have to spend too long getting up to speed with how things work.

Also, we build websites for all people which means we want our websites to be as inclusive as possible. This means a strong emphasis on [HTML semantics](/standards/html#semantics) as well as [accessibility](/standards/html#accessibility). Be kind to your users ðŸ’–!
