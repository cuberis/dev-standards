**Introduction**

Cuberis projects use Less for CSS pre-processing. Less extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that make CSS more maintainable, themable and extendable. Documentation on Less is available at [lesscss.org](http://lesscss.org).

Projects in vanilla CSS or other pre-processors such as Sass are also supported, if necessary.

Cuberis' CSS standards are heavily influenced by (**but differ from**) [Harry Roberts' CSS guidelines](http://cssguidelin.es/).

## Rulesets

The following terminology when discussing CSS rulesets is used at Cuberis:

	[selector] {
		[property]: [value];
	}

Property/value combinations are refered to as **declarations**.

### Syntax

#### Basic Syntax
Cuberis has strict standards regarding how rulesets are writtenâ€”for example:

	.feature-story,
	.blog-post {
		display: inline-block;
		position: relative;
		width: 25%;
		margin: 2rem 0;
		background: papayawhip;
	}

You'll notice the example above follows these guidelines:

1. In rulesets with multiple, comma-delimited selectors, each selector is on its own line
2. The opening bracket is on the same line as the last selector, separated from the last selector by a single space
3. Property/value declarations each appear on a single line
4. Each property/value declaration is indented once
5. The closing brace is on its own line
6. The closing brace is at the same indent level as the selector(s)

<!---
Additionally, properties should ideally be ordered as follows (some properties omitted for brevity):

1. display
2. position
3. [dimensions]
	1. width
	2. max-width
	3. height
	4. max-height
4. [box]
	1. margin
	2. padding
	3. box-sizing
5. [positioning]
	1. top
	2. left
	3. right
	3. bottom
6.

#### Coumpound Selectors

**Compound selectors** are selectors comprised of more than one chained selector. There are six types of selectors, and each can be used as part of a compound selector: **element selectors**, **IDs**, **classes**, **attribute selectors**, **pseudo-selectors** and **pseudo-elements**. These selectors should be combined in this order.

Examples of **incorrectly** combined compound selectors:

	.navigation#main-navigation {...}
	[data-name].orange {...}

Examples of **correctly** combined compound selectors:

	p.footnote.teal {...}
	.person:nth-child(odd)::after {...}

##app.less and what it means for _you_

Your app.less file should not contain any explicit attribute definitions. Rather, it should serve as a home for imported component files (e.g. buttons, lists, forms, etc) and merely assigned pre-designed library styles to explicitly-named application usages.

Your LESS directory should be broken into three distinct parts: globals, components, and app.less itself. Globals should contain code written in the most abstract, reusable way possible and be written with language that denotes their visual appearance. Think of globals as your block level elements--buttons, forms, type, etc. Globals should be the only place where explicit CSS is written.

Components should integrate globals as mixins, and be written with language that denotes their "purpose" on the page. Think of components as "sections" or "parts" of a website.

App.less contains nothing but import statements that compile your components and globals.

(Also I should at some point mention we use LESS, not SASS. Deal with it.)

Here's an example of what a \_globals file named \_buttons.less might look like. Note that modifiers are as descriptive as possible. (Also note the parantheses with .btn, which prevents it from being output to the compiled CSS file. )

	.btn() {
		border-radius: 4px;
		padding: 1em 2em;
		background: @grey;

		&.green {
			background: @green;
		}
		&.red {
			background: @red;
		}
		&.square {
			border-radius: 0;
		}	
		&.extra-padding {
			padding: 1.5em 3em;
		}
	}

This would then be used as a mixin within our \_components files. Let's say we have a button associated with a person and a button associated with a product. The person button is green and square, the product button is red and has extra padding. This is our \_person.less file:

	.person .btn {
		.btn.green.square();
	}

and this is our \product.less file:

	.product .btn {
		.btn.red.extra-padding();
	}

Our app.less file then looks something like this: 

	@import("globals/buttons.less");
	@import("components/person.less");
	@import("components/product.less");

This system allows for an element's display characteristics to maintain a separation between *what* it is and *how* it looks on a page. This in turn allows for maximum reusability of code because form and function are distinct.

##Nesting

The only time that nested selectors should be used is with LESS' & operator. This is useful for making modifiers children of their more general counterparts, which keeps "sibling" styles grouped together for maximum legibility and order. This may also be useful for pseudoelements (i.e. :before and :after).

##Hyphenation

There shall be no instances of double-hyphenation in class names.
