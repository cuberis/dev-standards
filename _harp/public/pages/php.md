## Documenting

### PHP code should be self documenting

For ease of readability, variable names should visually represent their purpose. Do not use abbreviations or letters for variable names without good reason.

```
// Good
$background_image = '/path-to-my-image.jpg';

// Bad
$bi = '/path-to-my-image.jpg';
```

### Doc Blocks

Every function must be documented with a doc block.
