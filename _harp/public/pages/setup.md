Every new project or maintenance client at Cuberis gets a dedicated Github repository. This provides a project with a usable history and is part of our deployment process.

To create a new repository a Development Team Member will log into Github and with in the Cuberis account create a new repository.

Once the new repo is created the developer can make their initial commit.

If creating a new project the initial commit should include baseline boilerplate files for the project which may include basic WP or Drupal files along with any other frameworks or plugins that are part of project baselines. This initial commit should take place before any additional CSS, JS or HTMl are added to the project.

If the repo is for a maintenance account or a new support client the initial commit should include all files as they were initially provided, before any updates or changes are made.

### .gitignore Files

Using an appropriate .gitignore file is critical.

Cubers' default .gitignore files are include in project baselines but may also be found on the  [Cuberis Gists Page](https://gist.github.com/cuberis).
